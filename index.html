<h1> Research </h1>

<p>
This research focuses on the development and application of biased molecular 
dynamics techniques for studying soft matter. Main focus is on the development 
of novel enhanced sampling algorithms for studying rare events such as ligand 
unbinding from proteins, which are typically inaccessible in unbiased molecular 
dynamics simulations due to ergodicity.

<p>
The research is led by Jakub Rydzewski, within the Department of Biophysics and 
Medical Physics at Institute of Physics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 
Poland.
