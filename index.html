<h1> Research </h1>

<p>
This research group focuses on the development enhanced molecular dynamics 
techniques for studying physical systems. 

We are interested in enhanced sampling methods for predicting kinetics and 
thermodynamics of complex systems using atomistic simulations, statistical 
mechanics and machine learning.

<p>
The research is led by Jakub Rydzewski, within the Department of Biophysics 
at the Institute of Physics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.
