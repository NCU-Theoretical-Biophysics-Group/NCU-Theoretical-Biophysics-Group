<h1> Photoisomerization and Photo-switchable drugs</h1>
<h2>Azobenzene functionalized sulfonylureas</h2> 
The concept of using light to control the action of drugs is not science-fiction anymore. Adding exogenous chromophores opens the possibility for precise light-control of protein switches. This idea is extensively exploited in optogenetics and optopharmacology. Using light allowed experimentalists to induce insulin from cells. The inward rectifying potassium channel KATP, which controls the insulin secretion in beta-cells, was opened and closed at will due to the photoisomerization of carefully designed molecules. The signal transduction goes from SUR1 to Kir6.2 complex due to a long-distance mechanical coupling between the chromophore and the pore. Using molecular dynamics simulations of SUR1 protein having the chromophore in the ground and excited singlet state conformations, we delineate differences in dynamics of these systems and provide a plausible explanation of artificially created photosensitivity in this complex system.
