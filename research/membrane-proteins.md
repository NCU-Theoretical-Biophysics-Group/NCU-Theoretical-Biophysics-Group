<h1>Proteins and their function</h1>

<h2>Ferroptosis and programmed cell death</h2>

Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of cell death, different from better known apoptosis or necrosis. Ferroptosis characteristic feature is increasing level of lipid peroxides where free radicals take electrons from the lipids causing the cell damage. Ferroptosis was identified as the mechanism of cell death in Parkinson and Huntington’s diseases, and sepsis. It plays a critical role in the treatment of cancers, and may contribute to the degradation of tissue in brain trauma, kidney diseases and asthma. 
Dr. Karolina Mikulska-Ruminska investigates with US collaborators the process of ferroptosis. They showed that in ferroptosis, the key role is played by two proteins, PEBP1 and lipoxygenase. Those two proteins form a complex (see Figure 1) and initiates lipid peroxidation which leads to the ferroptotic cell death signal [1]. The mechanism that trigger the ferroptotic cell death signal can be disturb by using specific inhibitors of PEBP1-lipoxygenase complex [2] or in a result of the nitric oxide interactions with PEBP1-lipoxygenase AA-PE substrate (Figure 1) [3]. To better understand the structural dynamics and function shared by lipoxygenase family members and their differentiation across different species we analyze a dataset of 88 crystal structures of lipoxygenase deposited in Protein Data Bank using elastic network models and molecular dynamics simulations [4]. We have also explained how PEBP1-lipoxygenase complex select the one type of substrate out of 50-115 others [5]. Other important study was performed on prokaryotic bacterium lipoxygenase (pLoxA) that does not contain AA-PE but still experimental and computational studies (elastic network models, phylogenetic analysis) showed that it can oxidize AA-PE and trigger ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (isolates from patients) [6]. This evolutionarily conserved mechanism of pLoxA-driven ferroptosis may represent a therapeutic target.
Explanation of ferroptosis at the molecular level using computational methods and its experimental verification is essential for developing new drugs and treatment methods. We are using a wide range of computational and bioinformatics methods such as all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics, molecular docking, homology modeling, elastic network models (GNM, ANM), phylogenetic analysis and more to better understand this process.

Figure 1. Computational model of PEBP1-lypoxygenase complex (PEBP1-15LOX, coordinates for both proteins obtained from X-ray) with catalytic site which consist of iron ion (denoted as the pink sphere) that is covalently bonded to histidines and isoleucine from lipoxygenase (green residues). Residues in blue belong to the entrance of the tunnel localized in the lipoxygenase. As a result of the interactions with nitric oxide the tunnel is opening. Residues that stabilize the interactions with nitric oxide in the catalytic site are displayed in orange. Yellow, dashed line indicates the nitric oxide pathway in lipoxygenase structure [3].

<h2> G-protein coupled receptors and signal transduction </h2>

 Mosquitos are the primary vectors of diseases that affect roughly 700 million and kill a million people each year. Malaria remains a major killer of children under five years old, taking the life of a child every two minutes. Unfortunately, the most commonly used repellents (i.e. DEET) lose their activity as mosquitoes become resistant. Moreover, they are found to be neurotoxic for humans, especially for children. Therefore, there is a high need for new generation of mosquito repellents.
        G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a crucial role in signal transduction and are target of 30-50% of all modern drugs. These receptors play a key role in activity of both human and insect neuronal system. Recent studies indicate that one of repellents mode of action is modulation of GPCRs but the precise mechanism remains obscure.
        Using molecular dynamics and docking we investigate the conformational changes in GPCRs, in response to ligands binding. Knowing the molecular basis of these changes will facilitate finding compounds that would serve as selective malaria vectors repellents having no side effects in human.

<h2> How does the ATP sensitive potassium channel work? </h2>
 Human well-being depends on good health. The metabolism of 51 amino acid (aa) protein hormone insulin is an important factor in maintaining health. ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) play a key role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. They close in response to a change in the ATP/ADP ratio and stop the K- outflow, leading to insulin release. Normally this happens when the blood glucose revel rises. Malfunctioning of KATP leads to diabetes. Despite its enormous physiological role, the mechanism of closing/opening of KATP is not known yet. Fortunately, since 2017 the KATP structure is known. It is a huge complex (~8000aa) composed of four Kir6.2 subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor moieties. This discovery opens a way to model the KATP channel gating. The complexity of KATP system calls for methods able to monitor structural changes. A standard approach is molecular dynamics, it may help to understand “bold-and-nuts” of opening/closing KATP channels. By performing extensive computer modeling of the whole KATP complex we hope to move towards understanding mechanisms of the KATP channel gating, and developing better antidiabetic drugs.
