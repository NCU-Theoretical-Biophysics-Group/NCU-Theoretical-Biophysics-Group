### Membrane proteins

1. Karoliny apoptoza
2. Beaty GPCR

 Mosquitos are the primary vectors of diseases that affect roughly 700 million and kill a million people each year. Malaria remains a major killer of children under five years old, taking the life of a child every two minutes. Unfortunately, the most commonly used repellents (i.e. DEET) lose their activity as mosquitoes become resistant. Moreover, they are found to be neurotoxic for humans, especially for children. Therefore, there is a high need for new generation of mosquito repellents.
        G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a crucial role in signal transduction and are target of 30-50% of all modern drugs. These receptors play a key role in activity of both human and insect neuronal system. Recent studies indicate that one of repellents mode of action is modulation of GPCRs but the precise mechanism remains obscure.
        Using molecular dynamics and docking we investigate the conformational changes in GPCRs, in response to ligands binding. Knowing the molecular basis of these changes will facilitate finding compounds that would serve as selective malaria vectors repellents having no side effects in human.
