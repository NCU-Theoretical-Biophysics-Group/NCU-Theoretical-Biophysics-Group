### Thermostability

Many biotechnologically important enzymes show low thermal stability. The thermostability of enzymes is crucial in exoenergetic reactions, where a lot of heat can be released and thus enzyme can lose activity. Sometimes bioreactors are specially heated to prevent the multiplication of unwanted microorganisms. In some cases of industrial enzymes activity is low or is too narrow or too wide toward the spectrum of substrates.


Figure 1. Nitrile hydratase, its nonstandard active site and reaction catalyzed by NHase. 


Nitrile hydratase (NHase, EC 4.2.1.84, Figure 1) is one of the most successful examples of using microbial enzyme in bioconversion of toxic nitriles to useful amides (Figure 2). This metalloprotein with posttranslationally modified cysteines is used in green chemistry in the production of many amides on the kiloton scale. Yearly over 600 kilotons of acrylamide and nicotinamide is produced using the NHase enzyme. Unfortunately wild types of NHase show low thermal stability and during large-scale bioconversion heated bioreactor destroys enzymes. In our group we are trying to explain why some mutational variants are more stable than others and to design new variants with improved thermostability [1, 2]. 
We also are trying to explain how the process of biotransformation of nitriles to amides occurs in NHase [3-5], how to re-design NHase to force this enzyme to be stereoselective [6]  or regioselective [7], and how this enzyme is activated by metalochaperones [8].
We are using molecular modeling tools, like molecular dynamics simulations, docking studies, quantum calculations or bioinformatics. All studies are conducted in close cooperation with the experimental group of Zhemin Zhou from the School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.
