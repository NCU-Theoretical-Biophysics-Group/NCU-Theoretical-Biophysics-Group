## Openings

We are interested in enhanced sampling methods for predicting kinetics and
thermodynamics of complex systems using atomistic simulations, statistical 
mechanics and machine learning.

We welcome all Bachelor and Master students who want to work on a research 
project in our group.

We have no PhD openings at the moment.
