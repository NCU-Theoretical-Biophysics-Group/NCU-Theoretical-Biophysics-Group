This research group focuses on the development of enhanced molecular dynamics 
techniques for studying physical systems. 

The research is led by Jakub Rydzewski, within the Institute of Physics, 
Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, Poland.

Our research lies at the intersection of physics, simulation methods and machine 
learning. We often build on insights that originated within the statistical
physics literature.

Some of our recent research interests include:
* Representation learning with physical meaning;
* Enhanced sampling methods with unsupervised learning of collective variables;
* Rare events in biophysical processes.
