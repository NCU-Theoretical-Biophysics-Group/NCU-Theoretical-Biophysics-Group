## Research

This research group focuses on the development enhanced molecular dynamics 
techniques for studying physical systems. 

Our research lies at the intersection of physics, simulations and machine 
learning. We often build on insights that originated within the statistical
physics literature.

The research is led by Jakub Rydzewski, within the Institute of Physics, 
Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.
