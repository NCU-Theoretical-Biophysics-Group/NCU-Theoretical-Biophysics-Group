# Research
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This research focuses on the development and application of biased molecular
dynamics techniques for studying soft matter. Main focus is on the development
of novel enhanced sampling algorithms for studying rare events such as ligand
unbinding from proteins, which are typically inaccessible in unbiased molecular
dynamics simulations due to ergodicity.

The research is led by Jakub Rydzewski, within the Department of Biophysics and
Medical Physics at Institute of Physics, Nicolaus Copernicus University in
Torun, Poland.
